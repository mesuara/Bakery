# Bakery


Friendly Bakery project-4, week-08 at the NYCDA bootcamp. First project I built with Ruby and Semantic ui. You can see the products for the bakery, the search bar on the left side helps you search for your favorite product in the store. When you navigate to the recipes selection on the left side bar it takes you to a page with another search bar. You just have to type an ingridient and it will show you the result from the API with some recipes that include that ingridient.


## Built with 
* Ruby(Ruby Sinatra, Httparty gem)
* Semantic ui
* Edamam API
